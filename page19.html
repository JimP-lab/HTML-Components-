      Greece’s popularity means there’s competition for travelers on a budget. But with some shopping around and keeping a few key strategies in mind, you can have a memorable visit without going broke in the process. Just be aware that in the peak summer season, like elsewhere, deals are much more elusive in Greece.
      <p>
        What's the cheapest way to get to Greece?
        <br>From Europe
        <br>The best affordable way to reach Greece from Europe is by plane, and your options are myriad. To Athens, budget carriers like easyJet and Ryanair have everyday cheap fares from across Europe, as do traditional carriers such as Air France and Lufthansa. Greece’s national carrier Aegean Airlines also offers cheap fares to Athens from all over Europe. Whether flying to Athens or directly to an island from Europe, take time to compare the fares as deals usually abound.
        <br>You can fly direct to islands with international airports, such as Crete, Mykonos, Rhodes and Santorini. Most of these flights are run by charter carriers and are very cheap. Online travel booking sites will show many of these flights.

        <br>Note that if you are flying a route to an island that involves a connection in Athens, it is often cheaper to get a fare to Athens and then purchase a separate ticket to the islands. However, this works best if you only have carry-on bags. Otherwise, you will need to retrieve your checked bags in Athens and recheck them for your flight to the island.
        <br>Alternatively, you can fly to Athens and then get a cheap ferry ride out to the islands from the port of Piraeus. Allow, at minimum, three hours for this transfer, which involves taking the frequent express bus from the airport. A better option is breaking your journey in Athens, where you can enjoy a glimpse of the Parthenon and a night in Plaka before continuing on your ferry.
        <br>From North America
        <br>The three main US carriers fly from their hubs in the east non-stop to Athens in the summer season. These flights are popular and tend to sell out, so unless you get a deal early, the cheapest option will be an itinerary that connects at one or more hubs to reach Athens. The same applies to flights from Canada.
        <br>From the rest of the world
        <br>Whether flying from Asia, Africa, the Middle East or Oceania, you'll find that many options for flights to Athens include a connection in Europe, the Middle East or North Africa. There’s no secret to cheap fares here; once you know your dates, start shopping as early as possible and compare the fares from as many airlines as possible.

        <br>May and October are the sweet-spot months to visit
        <br>July and August are the peak travel times for Greece, and there are few deals to be had. Airfares, ferry prices and accommodation rates are at their highest. Many places offering the best value sell out quickly, leaving people who wait to firm up their summer plans to pay the price.
        <br>June and September can be slightly cheaper than the very peak season. The shoulder months are great times to travel as all the ferries are running, every business is open, and the weather is excellent. The best deals on flights and accommodation may be a little more available than in July and August.
        <br>For many seasoned travelers to Greece, May and October are the sweet-spot months to visit the country. Just about everything is open and running, but there are fewer people, and rates and prices can fall by 25% or more. These are good months to find reasonable fares on non-stop flights to Athens from the US as well.
        <br>The off-season from November to April can be a rewarding time to visit Greece, but it comes with many caveats. The weather is often crisp and rainy, so this is not the time for a beach holiday. Much is closed, especially on the islands. Accommodation choices outside Athens are constrained, and flights and ferries to the islands operate at a very low level. The cheap charter airlines cut their schedules entirely. Rather than reduce their fares to attract passengers, major airlines simply cut their flights to Athens and deploy their planes to warm-weather destinations.

        <br>Accommodation deals depend on the season and how early you book
        <br>As always with travel, plan your trip as early as possible to secure the best deals on accommodation.
        <br>In the peak summer season, rates are at their highest. Don’t expect to find a brilliant double room in a popular destination for €50 ($58), but if you book early, you might find a great room for €150 ($173) as opposed to a room for the same price – or more – overlooking the trash cans in the alley.
        <br>During the high season, it also pays to consider package deals for Greece. Booking sites and airlines often offer all sorts of discounts if you book everything through one company. But also note that package accommodation deals are usually at large resorts or vast generic holiday apartment complexes, which may or may not be in an inviting part of your destination. Package deals are not where you’ll find the quaint little room with a view at an indie inn.
        <br>Also, note that the days when elderly ladies met ferries with offers of cheap spare rooms are long gone. Everything is on booking sites like booking.com, Airbnb and Vrbo.
        <br>In shoulder season, rates may be lower, and the choice of accommodation isn't snapped up as quickly – yet more reasons to consider travel in May, June, September and October..
